## 1.4.1 (2024-05-30)

### Bug fixes

Fix a bug where incremental parsing could inappropriately reuse a node when it ended in a repeat or optional part, and was followed by a sequence of skipped nodes longer than 25 characters.

## 1.4.0 (2024-01-22)

### New features

The new `InputStream.acceptTokenTo` method allows a tokenizer to create a token that ends at some absolute position.

## 1.3.14 (2023-11-02)

### Bug fixes

Further reduce maximum parse depth—the old limit could still cause the tree building function to overflow the stack on V8 when all rules on the stack produce actual visible tree nodes.

## 1.3.13 (2023-10-03)

### Bug fixes

The parser will now emit an error node when it reaches the end of the top rule but not the end of the input, and restarts parsing the top rule.

Fix an issue that could, when error-recovery happened after a skipped token, cause the parser to emit nodes whose start position was after their end position.

## 1.3.12 (2023-09-22)

### Bug fixes

Reduce tree depth limit to avoid V8 overflowing its stack.

## 1.3.11 (2023-09-19)

Fix a bug where the parser could skip characters while tokenizing in a local token group.

## 1.3.6 (2023-06-02)

### Bug fixes

Fix an issue where context-tracking parsers, in specific circumstances, could create incorrectly nested trees.

## 1.3.5 (2023-05-25)

### Bug fixes

Fix an issue where some grammars could make the parser unable to force reductions on invalid input, leading to trees that were missing some wrapping nodes around the broken input.

## 1.3.4 (2023-04-24)

### Bug fixes

Fix tokenizing of `@else` tokens that span separate input ranges.

## 1.3.3 (2023-02-02)

### Bug fixes

Fix a crash when parsing a non-atomic skippable at the top of a nested parse.

Fix a bug that caused the tree-depth limit on left-associative rules to be applied to rules generated for repeat operators.

## 1.3.2 (2023-01-31)

### Bug fixes

Place a limit on the amount of (non-recovering) parse stacks active at the same time to avoid exponential slowdown on inputs that nest ambiguous constructs.

Reduce the maximum left-associative nesting depth, since the old value could still cause Chrome (but not Firefox) to overflow its call stack.

## 1.3.1 (2023-01-13)

### Bug fixes

Fix a bug that could corrupt the parse stack when parsing a non-single-token skippable expression from the initial parse state.

## 1.3.0 (2023-01-09)

### Bug fixes

Avoid the problem of huge numbers of repeated left-associative operator applications creating a stack too deep to recurse on by detecting such parses and force-reducing out of them.

### New features

Add support for grammars that use `@local tokens` declarations.

## 1.2.5 (2022-11-16)

### Bug fixes

Fix a bug that made `Stack.canShift` incorrectly return true in some circumstances.

### Bug fixes

Fix a tokenizer bug that broke tokenizing of the character \uffff.

Fix an issue that could cause the tokenizer to crash when tokens ended directly on a gap in the input ranges.

## 1.2.1 (2022-08-03)

### Bug fixes

Include `LRParser.deserialize` in the TypeScript declarations.

Fix a bug that broke `ParserConfig.specializers` (requires @lezer/generator 1.1.1).

### Bug fixes

Avoid the need for generated parser files to directly import @lezer/common.

## 0.15.8 (2022-02-04)

### Bug fixes

Fix a bug that caused reductions that didn't consume anything to sometimes end up outside their parent node in the tree.

## 0.15.7 (2022-01-21)

### New features

`LRParser.configure` now takes a `contextTracker` option to replace the context tracker used by the parser.

## 0.15.0 (2021-08-11)

### Breaking changes

The module's name changed from `lezer` to `@lezer/lr`.

The `Parser` class was renamed to `LRParser` (`Parser` is now the abstract class that all parsers extend).

Nested parsing is no longer handled inside the LR parser (instead, it is done by using `parseMixed` from the `@lezer/common` package as a wrapper).

External tokenizers are passed different arguments and get a different input stream abstraction (to make accidental uncontrolled lookahead and lookbehind, which were easy ways to break incremental parsing, harder).

Drops support for `Stack.startOf` (which is no longer useful without lookbehind).

Context trackers also get passed different arguments, following the changed input stream format.

This package no longer re-exports bindings from `@lezer/common`.

### Bug fixes

Slightly prefer deleting token to inserting them to avoid far-fetched parses.

Fix a problem where node reuse didn't take the amount of look-ahead done by the tokenizer into account, and could reuse nodes whose content would tokenize differently due to changes after them.

Track tokenizer lookahead to fix a problem where some incremental parses would produce incorrect results.

### New features

LR parsers now support a `wrapper` configuration option that allows you to inject additional logic by wrapping the `PartialParse` object it returns.

## 0.13.5 (2021-05-14)

### Bug fixes

Fix a bug with overeager reuse of nodes on change boundaries.

## 0.13.4 (2021-03-03)

### New features

## 0.13.3 (2021-02-17)

### New features

Context trackers can now disable strictness in node reuse.

## 0.13.2 (2021-02-17)

### New features

Add support for context trackers.

## 0.13.1 (2020-12-04)

### Bug fixes

Fix versions of lezer packages depended on.

## 0.13.0 (2020-12-04)

### Breaking changes

`Parser.group` is now called `Parser.nodeSet`.

Nested parsers now work differently. They don't have to be Lezer parsers, but have to produce object conforoming to the `PartialParse` interface. The interface with which non-trivial nested parsers are specified also changed—see the `NestedParser` type.

Parser objects no longer have a `topType` property (scan their node set for types with `isTop` set instead).

`Parser` objects no longer have `withProps`, `withNested`, and `withTokenizer` methods (use `configure` instead).

Both `Parser.parse` and `Parser.startParse` now take an optional start position as second parameter and an optional parse context as third. `startParse` returns an instance of the `PartialParse` interface instead of the old `ParseContext` class (whose name is now used for something else). Parse _options_ are no longer passed to these methods, but configured in advance through `Parser.configure`.

During incremental parsing, instead of passing a tree as the `cache` option, reusable subtrees (see `TreeFragment` from lezer-tree) are now retrieved from the `fragments` property of the parse context object, if provided.

`Parser.parse` and `Parser.startParse` no longer take an options parameter. Instead, `bufferLength` and `strict` can be configured with `Parser.configure` now, and the start position and context are passed as optional arguments.

The `InputStream` type has been replaced by `Input` from the lezer-tree package (which has the same interface but a more appropriate name).

### New features

The `Parser` class now has a `configure` method that is used to create a parser instance with a more specific configuration.

## 0.12.1 (2020-11-19)

### Bug fixes

Fix an infinite loop in incremental parsing when repeatedly reusing a zero-length cached node.

## 0.12.0 (2020-10-23)

### Breaking changes

Follow the change from `Subtree` to `TreeCursor` in lezer-tree.

The serialized parser format changed.

`Stack.startOf` now returns null, rather than -1, when it can't find the given element.

### New features

`Stack.startOf` now takes an optional second argument that allows you to select a match beyond the innermost one.

## 0.11.2 (2020-09-26)

### Bug fixes

Fix lezer depencency versions

## 0.11.1 (2020-09-26)

## 0.10.4 (2020-09-15)

### New features

Parser objects now have a `withTokenizer` method that can be used to replace external tokenizers.

## 0.10.3 (2020-09-10)

### Bug fixes

Fix a bug that caused the value returned by `ParseContext.badness` to be much higher than intended.

## 0.10.2 (2020-09-02)

### Bug fixes

`Stack.ruleStart` will now ignore repeat rules and node-less rules when determining the inner rule.

Work around a failure mode where error-recovery got stuck in an end-of-grammar state and thus could not continue meaningfully parsing anything by restarting such states back to their initial state.

### New features

External tokenizers can now provide an `extend` flag to allow their tokens to be used alongside tokens produced by other tokenizers.

Add support for dynamic precedences.

## 0.10.1 (2020-08-20)

### Bug fixes

Fixes an issue where repeated error recovery could lead to a tree so deep that recursive functions on it would overflow the stack.

## 0.10.0 (2020-08-07)

### New features

Add support for grammar dialects.

Add support for external specializers.

Stacks now have a `parser` accessor that gets you the active parser instance.

### Breaking changes

No longer list internal properties in the type definitions.

Follow changes in the serialized parser format.

The way different tokenizers are combined is now slightly different. The first one to return a token wins, even if that token has no actions in the current state. The old behavior, where further tokenizers are tried until actions are found, can be enabled for a given tokenizer by setting its `fallback` flag.

Fix a crash that could occur when starting a nested parse when there were multiple active stacks.

Fix an issue where error nodes would sometimes not be merged.

Don't reuse cached tokens for states that have a different token group.

## 0.2.0 (2019-08-02)

### Bug fixes

Don't include lezer-tree inline in `dist/index.js`.

### New features
